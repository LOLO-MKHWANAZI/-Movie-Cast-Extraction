Lucille (Collins), a mailroom clerk, and Edward Joseph Murray II, who
sold lumber. He is of Irish descent. Among his siblings are actors
Brian Doyle-Murray,
Joel Murray, and
John Murray. He and most of his
siblings worked as caddies, which paid his tuition to Loyola Academy, a
Jesuit school. He played sports and did some acting while in that
school, but in his words, mostly ""screwed off."" He enrolled at Regis
College in Denver to study pre-med but dropped out after being arrested
for marijuana possession. He then joined the National Lampoon Radio
Hour with fellow members Dan Aykroyd,
Gilda Radner, and
John Belushi. However, while those three
became the original members of
Saturday Night Live (1975),
he joined
Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell (1975),
which premiered that same year. After that show failed, he later got
the opportunity to join
Saturday Night Live (1975), for which he earned his first Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing in a Comedy-Variety or Music Series. He later went on to star in comedy films, including Meatballs (1979), Caddyshack (1980), Stripes (1981), Tootsie (1982), Ghostbusters (1984), Ghostbusters II (1989), Scrooged (1988), What About Bob?

He grew up in Texas with his mother, Laura (Cunningham), a photographer; his father, Robert Andrew Wilson, an ad exec; and his brothers, Andrew Wilson (the eldest) and Luke Wilson (the youngest). Expelled from St. Mark's School of Texas (Dallas, TX) in the tenth grade, Wilson finished his sophomore year at Thomas Jefferson School and then headed to a military academy in New Mexico. He then attended the University of Texas at Austin, where he met his future mentor and friend, Wes Anderson. They wrote a screenplay, Bottle Rocket (1996), and sent it to their family friend, screenwriter L.M. Kit Carson, who sent it to producer Polly Platt, who gave it to James L. Brooks, who gave the Texans $5 million to make it into a feature film. Despite critical praise, Bottle Rocket (1996) only grossed one million dollars. After making the film, Wilson moved to Hollywood, setting up house with his two brothers and Anderson. Fairly quickly, Owen found himself acting in a series of big budget films, such as The Cable Guy (1996), The Haunting (1999), Anaconda (1997) and Breakfast of Champions (1999). This led to more work, such as Shanghai Noon (2000), Meet the Parents (2000) and Behind Enemy Lines (2001). He's known not only for his nose, which has been broken several times, but also for his 'free wheeling ways' with a script.

She has an older brother and a younger sister. When she was ten years old, her 40-year-old father died of a sudden heart attack. Her mother never remarried, and her grandmother moved in to help her mother.Cate graduated from Australia's National Institute of Dramatic Art in 1992 and, in a little over a year, had won both critical and popular acclaim. On graduating from NIDA, she joined the Sydney Theatre Company's production of Caryl Churchill's ""Top Girls"", then played Felice Bauer, the bride, in Tim Daly's ""Kafka Dances"", winning the 1993 Newcomer Award from the Sydney Theatre Critics Circle for her performance. From there, Blanchett moved to the role of Carol in David Mamet's searing polemic ""Oleanna"", also for the Sydney Theatre Company, and won the Rosemont Best Actress Award, her second award that year. She then co-starred in the ABC Television's prime time drama Heartland (1994), again winning critical acclaim. In 1995, she was nominated for Best Female Performance for her role as Ophelia in the Belvoir Street Theatre Company's production of ""Hamlet"". Other theatre credits include Helen in the Sydney Theatre Company's ""Sweet Phoebe"", Miranda in ""The Tempest"" and Rose in ""The Blind Giant is Dancing"", both for the Belvoir Street Theatre Company. In other television roles, Blanchett starred as Bianca in ABC's Bordertown (1995), as Janie Morris in G.P. (1989) and in ABC's popular series Police Rescue (1994). She made her feature film debut in Paradise Road (1997).Cate married writer Andrew Upton in 1997. She had met him a year earlier on a movie set, and they didn't like each other at first. He thought she was aloof, and she thought he was arrogant, but then they connected over a poker game at a party, and she went home with him that night. Three weeks later he proposed marriage and they quickly married before she went off to England to play her breakthrough role in films: the title character in Elizabeth (1998) for which she won numerous awards for her performance, including the Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Drama. Cate was also nominated for an Academy Award for the role but lost out to Gwyneth Paltrow. 2001 was a particularly busy year, with starring roles in Bandits (2001), The Shipping News (2001), Charlotte Gray (2001) and playing Elf Queen Galadriel in the ""Lord Of The Rings"" trilogy. She also gave birth to her first child, son Dashiell, in 2001. In 2004, she gave birth to her second son Roman.Also, in 2004, she played actress Katharine Hepburn in Martin Scorsese's film The Aviator (2004), for which she received an Academy Award as Best Supporting Actress. Two years later, she received an Academy Award nomination as Best Supporting Actress for playing a teacher having an affair with an underage student in Notes on a Scandal (2006). In 2007, she returned to the role that made her a star in Elizabeth: The Golden Age (2007). It earned her an Oscar nomination as Best Actress. She was nominated for another Oscar that same year as Best Supporting Actress for playing Bob Dylan in I'm Not There (2007). In 2008, she gave birth to her third child, son Ignatius. She and her husband became artistic directors of the Sydney Theatre Company, choosing to spend more time in Australia raising their three sons. She also purchased a multi-million dollar home in Sydney, Australia and named it Bulwarra and made extensive renovations to it. Because of her life in Australia, her film work became sporadic, until Woody Allen cast her in the title role in Blue Jasmine (2013), which won her the Academy Award as Best Actress. She ended her job as artistic director of the Sydney Theatre Company, while her husband continued there for two more years before he too resigned.In 2015, she adopted her daughter Edith in her father's homeland of the United States. That same year, she and her husband sold their multi-million dollar home in Australia at a profit and moved to America. Reasons varied from her wanting to work more in America to wanting to familiarize herself with her late father's American heritage. She played the title role of Carol (2015), a 1950s American housewife in a lesbian affair with a younger woman, for which she received an Oscar nomination as Best Actress. While most actresses might slow down in their forties, Blanchett did the opposite by stretching her boundaries even further, such as when she played 13 different characters in Manifesto (2015) and then making her Broadway debut in 2017 in ""The Present"", which is her husband's adaptation of Chekhov's play ""Platonov"" for which she earned a Tony nomination as Best Actress in a Play. Also in 2017, she was selected for the highest honor in her birth country: the Companion of the Order of Australia (AC).",Actress | Producer | Writer
https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001378/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_i4,Anjelica Huston,"BornJuly 8, 1951",NA,"Anjelica Huston was born on July 8, 1951 to director and actor John Huston and Russian prima ballerina Enrica 'Ricki' Soma. Huston spent most of her childhood overseas, in Ireland and England, and in 1968 first dipped her toe into the world of show business, taking on the lead role of her father's movie A Walk with Love and Death (1969). However, before it was released, her mother died in a car accident, at 39, and Huston relocated to the United States, where the very tall, exotically-beautiful young woman modeled for several years.While modeling, Huston made sporadic cameo appearances in a couple films, but decided to pursue it as a career in the early '80s. She prepared herself by reaching out to acting coach Peggy Feury and began to get roles. The first notable part was in Bob Rafelson's remake of the classic noir movie The Postman Always Rings Twice (1981) (in which Jack Nicholson, with whom Huston had been living since 1973, was the star). After a few more years of on-again, off-again supporting work, her father perfectly cast her as calculating, imperious Maerose, the daughter of a Mafia don whose love is scorned by a hit man (Nicholson again) in his film adaptation of Richard Condon's Mafia-satire novel Prizzi's Honor (1985). Huston won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her performance, making her the first person in Academy Award history to win an Oscar when a parent and a grandparent (her father and grandfather Walter Huston) had also won one.Huston thereafter worked prolifically, including notable roles in Francis Ford Coppola's Gardens of Stone (1987), Barry Sonnenfeld's film versions of the Charles Addams cartoons The Addams Family (1991) and Addams Family Values (1993), in which she portrayed Addams matriarch Morticia, Wes Anderson's The Royal Tenenbaums (2001) and The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou (2004). Probably her finest performance on-screen, however, was as Lilly, the veteran, iron-willed con artist in Stephen Frears' The Grifters (1990), for which she received another Oscar nomination, this time for Best Actress. A sentimental favorite is her performance as the lead in her father's final film, an adaptation of James Joyce's The Dead (1987) -- with her many years of residence in Ireland, Huston's Irish accent in the film is authentic.Endowed with her father's great height and personal boldness, and her mother's beauty and aristocratic nose, Huston certainly cuts an imposing figure, and brings great confidence and authority to her performances. She clearly takes her craft seriously and has come into her own as a strong actress, emerging from under the shadow of her father, who passed away in 1987. Huston married the sculptor Robert Graham in 1992. The couple lived in Venice Beach until Graham's death in 2008.",Actress | Producer | Director

His artistic curiosity in exploring the human condition leads him to projects all over the world, large and small, Hollywood films as well as Independent cinema.In 1979, he was given a role in Michael's Cimino's Heaven's Gate, from which he was fired. Since then, he has collaborated with directors who represent a virtual encyclopedia of modern cinema: James Wan, Robert Eggers, Sean Baker, Kenneth Branagh, Kathryn Bigelow, Sam Raimi, Alan Parker, Walter Hill, Mary Harron, Wim Wenders, Anton Corbijn, Zhang Yimou, Wes Anderson, Martin Scorsese, David Lynch, Oliver Stone, William Friedkin, Werner Herzog, Lars Von Trier, Abel Ferrara, Spike Lee, David Cronenberg, Paul Schrader, Anthony Minghella, Theo Angelopoulos, Robert Rodriguez, Phillip Noyce, Hector Babenco, John Milius, Paul Weitz, The Spierig Brothers, Andrew Stanton, Josh Boone, Dee Rees and Julian Schnabel.Dafoe has been recognized with four Academy Award nominations: Best Actor in a Supporting Role for Platoon, Best Actor in a Supporting Role for Shadow Of The Vampire, for which he also received Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild nominations, Best Actor in a Supporting Role for The Florida Project, for which he also received Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild nominations, and most recently, Best Leading Actor for At Eternity's Gate, for which he also received a Golden Globe nomination.

He is of mostly German, Irish, Scottish, and English descent. He and his wife, director Giada Colagrande, have made three films together: Padre, A Woman, and Before It Had A Name.His natural adventurousness is evident in roles as diverse as Marcus, the elite assassin who is mentor to Keanu Reeves in the neo-noir John Wick; in his voice work as Gil the Moorish Idol in Finding Nemo and Ryuk the Death God in Death Note; as Paul Smecker, the obsessed FBI agent in the cult classic The Boondock Saints; and as real life hero Leonhard Seppala, who led the 1925 Alaskan dog sled diphtheria serum run in Ericson Core's Togo.

Pennsylvania, one of four children of Shirley (Temeles), a radio
broadcaster who also ran an appliances firm, and Harold L. Goldblum, a
doctor. His father was of Russian Jewish descent and his mother was of
Austrian Jewish ancestry.Goldblum began his career on the New York stage after moving to the
city at age seventeen. Possessing his own unique style of delivery,
Goldblum made an impression on moviegoers with little more than a
single line in Woody Allen's
Annie Hall (1977), when he fretted
about having forgotten his mantra. Goldblum went on to appear in the
remake
Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)
and co-starred with Ben Vereen in the
detective series
Tenspeed and Brown Shoe (1980)
before a high-profile turn in the classic ensemble film
The Big Chill (1983).The quirky actor turned up in the suitably quirky film
The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension (1984),
which became a 1980s cult classic, starred in the modern-day film noir
Into the Night (1985), then went
on to a breakthrough role in the
David Cronenberg remake

actress Geena Davis, Goldblum's wife from
1987-1990 and co-star in two additional films:
Transylvania 6-5000 (1985)

Steven Spielberg's dinosaur adventure
Jurassic Park (1993) and its sequel
The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997),
as well as the alien invasion film

https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0852965/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_i8,Noah Taylor,"BornSeptember 4, 1969",NA,"Noah George Taylor, the elder of two boys, was born in 1969 in London, England, to Maggie (Miller), a journalist and book editor, and Paul Taylor, a copywriter and journalist. His family lived in both England and New Zealand before returning to his parents' native Australia in 1974. His parents divorced when he was a teenager and his father remarried--to theatre publicist, Suzie Howie. Noah left home at age 16 before graduating from University High School in Melbourne when he fell into acting. He decided to pursue his craft at St. Martin's Youth Theater. Despite his intense studies, the remote, slim-framed actor did not make his professional theater debut until March 1997 with Chekhov's ""The Seagull.""His work at St. Martin's led to an auspicious debut playing the painfully shy and sensitive teen Danny Embling in the coming-of-age film The Year My Voice Broke (1987). This affecting performance lost none of its heart-tugging appeal when the sequel Flirting (1991) came out four years later. Noah won awards for both films. Unconventionally typecast as the gawky, gloomy-eyed, somewhat manic depressive, directors started lining up to use the young actor. It all culminated in what is arguably the best known performance of his career--as the young, tortured genius, pianist David Helfgott, in Shine (1996). Working in tandem with Oscar-winner Geoffrey Rush, who played Helfgott as an older adult, Noah's scenes with Armin Mueller-Stahl, who played the pianist's egregiously abusive father, were incredibly powerful and helped him to win the Film Critics Circle of Australia and Fort Lauderdale International Film Festival awards. The variety of Noah's performances have been stunning over the years. He played a young Adolf Hitler in the drama Max (2002), a ""what-if"" spin on Hitler growing up as an angry tortured artist instead of a Fascist dictator following World War I. He played the darkly humorous protagonist in He Died with a Felafel in His Hand (2001) and the titular Jewish outcast in Simon Magus (1999).Music, songwriting and art have been other strong passions for Noah. In 1994 he became part of a band called ""The Honky Tonk Angels. A singer-guitarist, included in this band were Noah's co-stars from previous movies Loene Carmen and Kym Wilson. He has also formed other bands with such names as Cardboard Box Man, Flipper & Humphrey and The Thirteens, a country-western rock group.American audiences have taken an equal ""shine"" to Noah recently, particularly as the manager of Stillwater in the popular film Almost Famous (2000); as Bryce in the popular adventure film Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) and its sequel which both starring Angelina Jolie; a featured role in Vanilla Sky (2001) which starred Tom Cruise; and in the ""Willy Wonka"" extravaganza Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005) as Mr. Bucket.",Actor | Script and Continuity Department | Soundtrack

Rochelle, New York. The second of five children, he grew up in Rye, New
York, the son of Joseph P. Cox, an orchestra leader, pianist, and owner
of a successful men's clothing store in Rye, and Alma M. Court a former
newspaper and Life magazine reporter and an executive asst. at M.G.M.
in New York City. From early childhood on, Bud displayed a remarkable
acting ability and appeared in countless school plays and community
theatre. Also a talented painter, he earned extra money doing portraits
at art fairs and by commission to the people in Rye. However, he knew
acting was his real dream and began riding trains into New York City at
the age of 14 to begin studying with his first teacher Bill Hickey at
the HB Studios in Greenwich Village.Upon graduation from Iona Prep School run by the Christian Brothers of
Ireland, Bud applied to the NYU School of the Arts, now known as Tisch.
Unfortunately, the acting department was full but after seeing Bud's
art portfolio he was admitted as a scenic design major in 1967. Bud
continued to study with Bill Hickey and secretly began to work in
commercials, - off Broadway Theater, and the soap opera, ""The Doctors.""He formed a comedy team with actress Jeannie Berlin, and later with
Judy Engles, performing Bud's original comedy material all over
Manhattan's burgeoning nightclub scene. Bud and Judy won first place
during amateur night at the famed Village Gate and were signed to a
management contract with the club's owner. Soon after, while appearing
at the famed Upstairs at the Downstairs in the musical revue ""Free
Fall,"" Bud was spotted by Robert Altman who was in New York looking for
actors for his film ""M. A. S. H."" Bud was hired and from that went on
to play the title role in Altman's next film ""Brewster McCloud.""A quirky May-Dec. love story, ""Harold and Maude,"" next saw Cort
opposite Ruth Gordon in arguably his most famous role. After a confused
reception, the film went on to become not only one of the most
successful cult movies in history, but eventually was crowned an
American Film Classic. Bud was also awarded the French equivalent of
the Oscar, the Crystal Star, for Best Actor of the Year. He was also
nominated for a Golden Globe and a British Academy Award.Resisting type casting, Bud turned down the role of Billy Bibbit in
Milos Forman's ""One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest"" and returned to the
theater. He made his Broadway debut opposite Donald Pleasance in Simon
Gray's ""Wise Child"" at the Helen Hayes Theatre in 1971. Again he
resisted being type cast by Hollywood and finally made his first film
five years after ""Harold and Maude,"" in the political thriller
""Darkness of the Brain"" or ""Flash"" opposite Marcel Bozzuffi (The
Conformist).Title roles in ""Why Shoot the Teacher?"" (one of the most successful
films in Canadian history), ""The Secret Diary of Sigmund Freud,"" (a
comedy with Klaus Kinski and Carol Kane), and ""She Dances Alone"" (a
documentary/fantasy about the real life daughter of Vaslav Nijinski,
with Max Von Sydow) followed and led to countless more films. His
latest films being the Wes Anderson comedy ""The Life Aquatic"" (with
Bill Murray and Cate Blanchett) as well as ""The Number 23"" (with Jim
Carrey). Besides his film and theater work, Bud has sung all over the
world from Carnegie Hall in New York, to the Alcazar in Paris. He was
the youngest actor ever given an homage at the Cinematheque in Paris in
an evening hosted by the great comedic actor, Jacques Tati.Bud lived as a house guest for many years with his dear friend Groucho
Marx. In 1979 Bud survived a near fatal car crash on the Hollywood
Freeway. He continued working in film and theater and co-founded the LA
Classic Theatre Works with, among others, Richard Dreyfuss and Rene
Auberjonois. Bud performed the entire J. D. Salinger novel ""The Catcher
in the Rye"" live in-studio, as well as the one man show, ""An Evening
with Truman Capote"" for the radio station KCRW. He appeared with Tom
Waits in the L.A. Premiere of Thomas Babe's ""Demon Wine"" and was
nominated for the LA Theatre Critics Best Actor award for his
performance in Samuel Beckett's ""ENDGAME,"" which he first played in New
York at the Cherry Lane Theatre. For his performance as Clov, Bud was
awarded the Dramalogue Award as Best Actor.Recent films include Kevin Smith's ""Dogma"", Ed Harris' ""Pollock"", and
his own controversial film, ""Ted and Venus"" (Col. Tri Star Home Video)
which Bud directed, co-wrote, and starred in with Woody Harrelson and
Gena Rowlands and which initially, like ""Harold and Maude"" disturbed
some critics and yet was hailed as a ""tiny masterpiece,"" and ""a
courageous film, Bud Cort's finest performance.""Bud is a member of the Director's Unit of the Actor's Studio. Besides
Bill Hickey, he has studied extensively with Stella Adler, Joan

https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001025/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_i16,Seymour Cassel,"BornJanuary 22, 1935",NA,"Seymour Cassel, the veteran character actor who was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role as the hippie swinger Chet in John Cassavetes' Faces (1968), studied acting at the American Theatre Wing and at the Actors Studio. He made his movie debut in Cassavetes' first film, Shadows (1958), on which he also served as associate producer.Seymour Joseph Cassel was born on January 22, 1935 in Detroit, Michigan, to Pancretia Ann (Kearney), a performer, and Seymour Joseph Cassel, who owned a night club. His father was of Russian Jewish and German Jewish descent, and his mother was of Irish heritage. Cassel's early career was tied to Cassavetes, who himself had a flourishing career as an actor on television and in major Hollywood productions in addition to becoming, arguably, the first great independent movie director after the collapse of the studio system in the late 1950s/early 1960s. As for Cassel, after his uncredited role in ""Shadows,"" he co-starred with Cassavetes in The Webster Boy (1962) and Too Late Blues (1961) before winding up in support of his friend in Don Siegel's drama The Killers (1964), a movie shot for TV that had to be released theatrically due to its heightened violence (it was also Ronald Reagan's last movie). Cassel primarily made his living on TV in the 1960s, frequently typecast as beatniks and hippies. He had a supporting role in the Cassavetes-directed episode ""A Pair of Boots"" (1962) for The Lloyd Bridges Show (1962) as well as appearing on such popular programs as 12 O'Clock High (1964), Combat! (1962) and The F.B.I. (1965) before scoring with his aging hippie in ""Faces"" at the end of that tumultuous decade.Along with ""Shadows,"" ""Faces"" remained his favorite Cassavettes film. In addition to acting, Cassel was also a crew member on the film, as the technical staff numbered all of seven. He helped shoot the film as a second cameraman, as well as adjusting the lighting. As the film was financed by Cassavettes himself, there were no union regulations to deal with, nor a studio schedule to keep.Several of Cassavettes' films were shot in continuity, so the actors could develop a character in sequence--similar to stage acting--rather than the traditional method of film making, which is shot out of sequence. Cassel had stated that this technique enhanced the success of his works by eliminating the ""fourth wall"" between the audience and the actors. He believed that acting tells the film's story, not the images and that what is important is how the audience relates to the characters on screen.As their careers matured, Cassel also co-starred with Cassavetes in two TV movies, Nightside (1973) and Nightside (1973) and appeared in supporting roles in three more Cassavetes-directed films: The Killing of a Chinese Bookie (1976), Opening Night (1977) and Love Streams (1984).In addition to appearing in studio films, Cassel remained prominent in the American independent film community since the death of his friend and collaborator. He contributed a cameo appearance in the directorial debut of Steve Buscemi (with whom he appeared as a co-star in the black comedy In the Soup (1992)), Trees Lounge (1996), and has appeared in three films by Wes Anderson: Rushmore (1998), The Royal Tenenbaums (2001) and
The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou (2004).Cassel was prized by independent directors for two things: his positive nature, and his (perhaps) facetious declaration that he'd be in any independent film for the price of a plane ticket if he liked the script.He died on April 7, 2019 in Los Angeles, California.",Actor | Cinematographer | Additional Crew
